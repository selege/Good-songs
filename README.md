As part of the Software Engineering Class, we would like to simulate how Open Source Projects start and try to attract potential contributions.

# Rules

1. Please choose a hobby or some interest that you want to build your repository
2. Make a README to announce this theme (i.e., my favourite video games or anime)
3. Attract - Go to https://github.com/NAIST-SE/AttractingContributors/discussions, post an interesting message to ask other members to add a list. See example below.
4. Please collect up to 10 hobbies or interest from other contributors. You can also discuss and talk about the hobby before you merge their Pull Request.

# Requirements
To complete the assignment, please do the following:
1. Fork this project and then rename the title to your hobby. 
2. Announce the new project and try to attract other members.
3. Make 10 Pull Request contributions to other projects

# My Project - (Favorite Motorcycle or Bicycle). 

Please help me with contributing of your favorite motorcycle or bicycle.

For example, write your favorite motorcycle that you would like to ride some day or you think it's just looking beautiful. For me it's "Honda CRF 250".
If you don't like  motorcycles write about bicycles.
If you don't like non of above, write "I like my feet more than wheels". LOL ))))
If you want you can add a link to the motorcycle/bicycle picture near the model name.

To do a contribution copy below "0." line and edit it to your favorite model (link isn't mandatory), then paste it to the last bottom line of this README file.
